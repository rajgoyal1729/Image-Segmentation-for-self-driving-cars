# Image-Segmentation-for-self-driving-cars 
The rapid development of self-driving car technology has highlighted 
the critical need for accurate and efficient image segmentation 
systems. Image segmentation enables autonomous vehicles to 
precisely identify and classify various elements in their environment, 
such as pedestrians, vehicles, road signs, and lane markings. However, 
existing segmentation algorithms often struggle with the complexity 
and variability of real-world driving scenarios, leading to potential 
safety risks.

â€¢ Library required to build the model: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, 
Scikit-Learn, Scikit-Image

â€¢ Framework Used: Tensorflow

â€¢ Model: U-net CNN architecture.

**Algorithm Selection**:

â€¢ **Data Characteristics**:

â€¢ High-resolution images with detailed annotations.

â€¢ Diverse urban driving scenes with varied objects and environmental conditions.

**â€¢ Why U-Net:**

â€¢ Accuracy: High effectiveness in image segmentation, offering detailed segmentation maps.

â€¢ Efficiency: Suitable for real-time applications due to computational efficiency.

â€¢ Versatility: Handles variability in real-world scenarios, capturing fine-grained details and context.

â€¢ Proven Success: Robust and reliable in complex segmentation tasks across different fields.

**â€¢ Data Input:**

â€¢ This dataset has 2975 training images files and 500 validation image files. Each image file is 256x512 pixels, and each file is a 
composite with the original photo on the left half of the image, alongside the labeled image (output of semantic segmentation) on the 
right half.

**â€¢ Training Process:**

â€¢ Used the data augmentation to create more data and used dropout layer additionally in the architecture. 

**â€¢ Prediction Process:**

â€¢ The trained algorithm takes the input images and it is passed through the virtual true mask by U-net model to predict the actual mask 
segmented for the self-driving cars.

**Importance**ðŸ”­

â€¢ Importance of Image Segmentation for Self-Driving Cars

â€¢ Obstacle Detection: Precise segmentation is crucial for identifying 
obstacles (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles) to ensure safe navigation.

â€¢ Traffic Sign Recognition: Accurate segmentation of traffic signs and signals 
is essential for obeying traffic rules and ensuring safety.

â€¢ Lane Marking Detection: Reliable segmentation of lane markings helps in 
maintaining the correct lane and assists in lane-keeping systems.

â€¢ Environmental Understanding: Comprehensive segmentation of the 
driving environment (e.g., roads, sidewalks, buildings) improves the overall 
situational awareness of autonomous vehicles.
